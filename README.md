# README.md

Provides monokai color scheme for the recent versions of IDLE.

I started with Python 3.7.6 and couldn't find the perfect monokai .cfg file. This modified highlight scheme is definitely compatible
with all versions of IDLE Python between 3.7.6 and 3.8.1 (64-bit).

How to enable monokai color scheme:

1. Make a copy of your own .idlerc/config-highlight.cfg just to be on the safe side.
2. Replace your .idlerc/config-highlight.cfg file with the one provided here.
3. Enjoy!
