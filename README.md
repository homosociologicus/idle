# README.md

Provides monokai color scheme for the recent versions of IDLE.

I started with Python 3.7.6 and couldn't find the perfect monokai .cfg file. This modified highlight scheme is definitely compatible
with all versions of IDLE Python between 3.7.6 and 3.8.1 (64-bit).

How to enable monokai color scheme:

1. Make a copy of your own .idlerc/config-highlight.cfg just to be on the safe side.
2. Replace your .idlerc/config-highlight.cfg file with the one provided here.
3. Replace 'name' variable with 'monokai' in the [Theme] block in your .idlerc/config-main.cfg file.
4. If it does not apply automatically with the next launch of IDLE, try to find it in IDLE settings and enable it.
5. Finally, you can always play with the source code of the scheme and .cfg files (be careful, make copies before modifying).
6. Enjoy!
